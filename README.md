Game of Life Optimization Using GPU Parallelism (and potentially SIMD)
### What is this repository for? ###

* An investigation into how certain optimization techniques (GPU Parallelism/SIMD Vectorization) affect the speed-up of Conway's Game of Life.


### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone the repository
* In order to use the openACC version of the code, please ensure you have some GPU processing on your machine
* How to run tests
